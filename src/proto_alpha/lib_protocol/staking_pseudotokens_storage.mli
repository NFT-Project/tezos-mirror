(** [credit_frozen_deposits_pseudotokens_for_tez_amount ctxt delegate tez_amount]
    increases [delegate]'s stake pseudotokens by an amount [pa] corresponding to
    [tez_amount] multiplied by the current rate of the delegate's frozen
    deposits pseudotokens per tez.
    The function also returns [pa].

    This function must be called on "stake" before transferring tez to
    [delegate]'s frozen deposits. *)
